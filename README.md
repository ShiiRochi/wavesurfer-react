# Wavesurfer React
This repository is a homepage of wavesurfer-react package, that is built upon [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org).


# Why?
This package is intended to be an abstraction over wavesurfer.js and as much close to react style of doing things as its maintainer can provide.

# Demo
You can see how this package is intended to be used [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/wavesurfer-react-ce3zc)

# Roadmap
 - [ ] Easy plugin add and remove after mount*
 - [ ] Easy WaveForm redraw if some of its options have changed. (see what `drawBuffer` does)
 - [ ] Typings: PropTypes vs Flow vs TypeScript.
 
P.S. Tasks that are marked with start are in theory possible.
